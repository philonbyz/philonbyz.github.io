Hi! I am Leqi Zhou, a senior at MIT studying Mathematics (Course 18) and AI & Decision Making (Course 6-4).

I am interested in probability and how to apply it to design inference and generative algorithms, understand limits, machine learning models, and the physical world.

You can reach me at `leqizhou [at] mit [dot] edu`.

Please see my [CV]({{ "/cv/" | relative_url }}) and [publications]({{ "/publications/" | relative_url }}).
