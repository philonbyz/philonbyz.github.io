<p>Natalie Zemon Davis’s <i>The Return of Martin Guerre</i> is the kind of history book you read for fun: accessible, elegant, and engaging. The story itself is extraordinary: in a 16th-century French village, a wealthy farmer named Martin Guerre abandoned his wife and child and disappeared. His wife Bertrande refused to seek a divorce, and Martin’s uncle Pierre became her guardian. Twelve years later, a local man named Arnauld du Tilh—hereafter “the false Martin”—returned pretending to be Martin Guerre. He lived intimately with Bertrande and managed the household’s business affairs. Several years later, Uncle Pierre, amid a property dispute, filed a lawsuit accusing the false Martin of impersonation, claiming it in Bertrande’s name. Villagers were divided, and the case was eventually sent to the Parlement of Toulouse. The court imprisoned the false Martin and Bertrande separately, yet their testimonies were perfectly consistent. Just as the false Martin was about to be acquitted, the real Martin—now with a wooden leg, amputated after wartime injury—dramatically reappeared. The false Martin was sentenced to hanging, and his body was burned to “wipe out every memory of such a vile and detestable man.”</p>

<p>And yet, the case became famous precisely because judge Jean de Coras and writer Guillaume Le Sueur wrote books about it, turning it into a popular legend. In that sense, the false Martin achieved a strange sort of immortality. The motives of these authors are thought-provoking, and Davis’s discussion is fascinating. When Coras was ten, he wrote a maxim for himself: “Follow reason.” Yet even he could not help admiring how flawlessly the false Martin carried off the impersonation, and in his book he reflects on how his devotion to reason nearly led him to misjudge the truth. Montaigne invoked the case to argue that human reason is less reliable than we think, and therefore we must be tolerant: when facts are uncertain, delay judgment—don’t rush into irrevocable acts like hanging someone.</p>

<p>But a court must ultimately give a verdict and provide closure to villagers with conflicting testimonies. Davis also explores the tension between social expectations and rational judgment in the case. Suppose the real Martin had never returned. As readers who know the full story, would acquitting the false Martin feel like justice? Should the law pursue “truth” (a real man’s legitimate claim to property and family), or protect the functioning household (avoiding turning a woman and her child into destitute dependents)? If someone fulfills their social role well—the false Martin was in many ways a better farmer and husband than the real one—how important is their true identity? As an anonymous internet enthusiast, I was particularly struck by the question Davis raises: “When does self-fashioning end and impersonation begin?”</p>

<p>Later scholars have speculated that Bertrande always knew the false Martin was an impostor, yet chose to protect him until the real Martin appeared—and she was ultimately not convicted of adultery. Compared to the false Martin’s impersonation, was the court more unsettled by Bertrande’s agency and capability as a woman within this situation? Did they prefer to acquit her and explain her actions away as the gullibility of a “weak” woman?</p>

<p>The fact that Davis draws so many insights out of such a small episode is truly impressive. Because the case is so local—microhistory—the archival work is meticulous and convincing, vividly reconstructing rural society and daily life. The writing is gentle and lucid, weaving narrative with analysis. Davis’s interpretations are measured and thought-provoking. I especially loved her humility at the end: “I believe I have uncovered the historical truth—or has the false Martin deceived us yet again?” I’ll leave that for readers to judge.</p>
